GyroLinearAcceleration
======================

Android linear acceleration from an acceleration sensor and gyroscope sensor fusion using Cardan angles.

Measure linear acceleration with your Android device! Gyro Linear Acceleration uses a accelerometer and gyroscope sensor fusion to estimation linear acceleration with almost no lag time in the correction. You can visualize the output with sweet line graphics and awesome gauges to quickly compare outputs and you can even log the output to a .csv file!

An accelerometer can measure the static gravity field of earth (like a tilt sensor) or it can measure measure linear acceleration (like accelerating in a vehicle), but it cannot measure both at the same time. When talking about linear acceleration in reference to an acceleration sensor, what we really mean is Linear Acceleration = Measured Acceleration - Gravity. The hard part is determining what part of the signal is gravity.

Sensor fusions take measurements from multiple sensors and fuse them together to create a better estimate than either sensor could do by itself. The most common type of sensor fusion to determine linear acceleration is an accelerometer and gyroscope, which measures the rotation of the device. If you know the rotation of the device and the acceleration of gravity, you can determine the tilt of the device and subtract that from the measured acceleration to get linear acceleration. However, not all devices have gyroscopes. You will need one on your device to use Gyro Linear Accleration.

What would you want to measure the linear acceleration of? Lots of freaking amazing stuff.

For example, you can measure the linear acceleration of (not recommended):

• Your car driving around a road course
• Your mountain bike going up a hill
• Your plane accelerating
• Your dog chasing your cat
• Your R/C truck flying through the air
• Your rockets for your science fair project

Totally impress your friends with all these cool features!

Features:
• Log all of your data in real-time
• Spiffy gauges to display the outputs
• Pretty graphs to visualize how awesome your filter is working

Yup, you can make your phone at least 10 times more amazing (rough estimate) by downloading Gyro Linear Acceleration and then measuring the linear acceleration of you doing something super sweet.
